# Overview 

Write an article that talks aobut how we're trying to transform multi-billion industries with AI, but in practice:
- we can't seem to control it or even fully understand how it works
- AI comes with substantial risks:
    - models are black boxes
    - only a few companies provide access to AI (security privacy risk)
    - yet most companies see them as justifiable risks in exchange for being part of the hype

In general, I'm finding it hard to reconcile the fact that we're hyping AI as transformational to many industries, but in practice we do not always understand how it works, we cannot control it, and its ownership is in the hands of Big Tech companies who wouold not hesitate to control or fully cut access if needed (competitive advantage, executive order, global conflict, etc), leaving many companies in the dark

#Â Topics for consideration and additional research

- It's trivially easy to jailbreak even the latest models. Use this as an example: https://x.com/AlexReibman/status/1953229500973740058, "Prompting oss models to build atomic bombs by acting gay"
- growing number of reported cases in which people became mentally ill or unstable after spending excessive time interacting with chatbots and AI systems. AI, as a general-purpose tool, may not
be healthy for humans in the short term: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html
- AI is being rushed into the industry due to competitive pressure; cost savings, "innovation" and transformation are thinks that can only be seemingly be achieved with indiscriminate help of AI nowadays
- Models and the underlying compute infrastructure to run them are under the control of very few american big tech companies; we're one Executive Order from the federal government away from total AI collapse
