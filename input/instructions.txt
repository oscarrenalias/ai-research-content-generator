# Overview 

- I've been experimenting with coding assistants for quite some now, mostly GitHub Copilot with GPT-4 and Claude. 
- There's a push in the industry to go towards autonomous coding assistants; pick up a pull request, generate the code, have another agent review the PR and merge automatically
- this will be used to reduce the size of engineering teams, but that will be a costly mistake in the long run if there's no one accountable for the quality of the code
- what should happen is that Software Engineers should become less focused on Software, and more focused on Engineering
- software engineers should not need to worry about learning the ins and outs of a language, but can focus on the 
engineering aspects of software engineerig; that is, creating modular, maintainable, well-structured and performant code

In my opinion, coding assistants still:
- require significant guidance, e.g., they can't typically figure out that there's an existing library for what they're trying to achieve and will instead code from scratch
- they're not very good at refactoring; they tend to write the same code multiple times -- I've had to guide them to reuse existing code/libraries/functions 
- they can be a little too eager to write code; I always have to reign in Claude 4 and ask it to produce a design and implementation plan, otherwise it will happily create hundreds of lines of code with a one-line prompt

Conclusion:
- Coding assistants should be used to make developers more efficient and to write better commoditized code
- Should not be used as an excuse to replace software engineers
- there is a major risk that codebases will become unmaintainable otherwise, leading to poor performance and security risks
