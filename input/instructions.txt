Write an article that talks aobut how we're trying to transform multi-billion industries with AI, but in practice:

Please weave in the following topics:

be healthy for humans in the short term: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html
- AI is being rushed into the industry due to competitive pressure; cost savings, "innovation" and transformation are thinks that can only be seemingly be achieved with indiscriminate help of AI nowadays
- Models and the underlying compute infrastructure to run them are under the control of very few american big tech companies; we're one Executive Order from the federal government away from total AI collapse
