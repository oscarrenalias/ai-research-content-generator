# Overview 

- Industry-push to leverage AI coding assistantsa and agents. Companies like Coinbase are already producing 40% of their code with AI
- the underlying assumption is that IT leaders will use to reduce the size of engineering teams -- in my opinion, this is the wrong approach
- my view is that the role of a software engineer will shift; it will be less about software (knowing all the ins and outs of a language and
a framework) and more about *engineering*: does this code do what it's supposed to do? should it be refactored? is it performant? is it secure? it will
allow engineers to spend time to ensure that code is good and high-quality as opposed to fiddling with a language, platform or framework

In my experience:
- coding assistants work well for commoditized code
- need to be guided to the right design; they're usually very eager to write code. Claude Code has a planning mode, which is great, but
Copilot Agent needs to be reigned in and must be forced to design before generating code
- still require significant guidance, e.g., can't typically figure out that there's an existing library for what they're trying to achieve and will instead code from scratch
- they're not very good at refactoring; they tend to write similar code multiple times -- I've had to guide them to reuse existing code/libraries/functions 

Conclusion:
- Coding assistants should be used to make developers more efficient and to write commoditized code
- Should not be used as an excuse to replace software engineers
- there is a major risk that codebases will become unmaintainable otherwise, leading to poor performance and security risks
