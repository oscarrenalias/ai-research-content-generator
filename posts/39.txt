It's really about time (15 years!) that Microsoft replaced Calibri as the default font in Office with something else: https://lnkd.in/d-f26Fw. I really don't know what it is about it but I've always found Calibri totally boring and undifferentiating, too round and plain. And it's a default font, that never helps either!
