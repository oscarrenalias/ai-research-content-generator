#COP28 was such an unmitigated disaster and a major missed opportunity to address the existential threat of global warming. 

The summit failed produce any meaningful results, with an absolutely disappointing and bland draft deal that failed to address the key issue with phasing out fossil fuels. Instead, focus remained on short-term financial gain for a few — global oil producer nations, and the companies that profit from it, at the expense of the wellbeing of the entire planet and humanity as a whole. Who cares about little island nations being swallowed whole by the sea when a few can add some more billions to their bank accounts, right?

I think we deserve what's coming to us if we don’t act. It’s time to take responsibility and work together to create a sustainable future for us and for our descendants.
