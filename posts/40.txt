Great article, and we don’t really need more than what we already have to create a bit of small talk. Personally, I’ve recently started to use “unusual” backgrounds in my Teams calls, mostly geeky stuff like backgrounds from The Expanse, famous movies or screens from video games. Some people identify what the backgrounds are (turns out I work with quite a few like-minded geeks! 🤓), while others will at least ask about them... Either way it all leads to small talk and a level of personal interaction that wouldn’t have been there otherwise!
