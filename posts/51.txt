TikTok (former Musical.ly), has gone from silly 30-sec videos to a national security threat for the US, and it’s owned by a Chinese company too. I don't see the US so worried about YouTube though... You can always count on Google, I guess, but it’s interesting to see how the control of social media platforms is also an important aspect of national security.
