For fuck’s sake, I would really like to use the LinkedIn feed to keep up with cool current and former colleagues, but I can’t. I just can’t. It’s such a usability mess and littered with ads that do not interest me in the slightest. Oh, and good luck finding something you saw a minute ago if you happen to refresh the feed by mistake; nope, you’re not seeing it ever again!

Also, when did LinkedIn become a place to repost Reddit, TikTok and Facebook memes and videos?? 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
