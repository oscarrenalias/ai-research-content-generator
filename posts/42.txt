Google’s “Federated Learning of Cohorts” (FLoC) is a complicated solution for a problem that shouldn’t exist: “a new way that browsers could enable interest-based advertising on the web, in which the companies who today observe the browsing behavior of individuals instead observe the behavior of a cohort of similar people” - in short, tracking of users across the web. 

Google is obviously planning to build this into Chrome and leverage their dominant position as the most used browser, currently. Personally, I’m happy to have ditched Chrome and replaced it with Microsoft Edge but through the rise and fall of IE and Chrome we have simply replaced a large threat to the web with another, and the cycle is repeating again but with players reversed... And got users even more monetized in the process.
