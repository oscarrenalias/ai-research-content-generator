t is indeed a bit of a pity as Apple is by far the company taking the most comprehensive approach to guaranteeing AI privacy safeguards in their products (on paper, at least), including on-device AI compute for many of the queries. However, the reason why they're not rolling out the features in the EU market is because they're being petty and spiteful towards the EU due to the recent regulatory setbacks here, nothing more. But then, this is LinkedIn where people like to post exagerated idiotic memes for internet points and likes, how can one possibly expect a nuanced discussion around here.

As for Llama's case, we should look deeper into why it isn't available in the EU. Whereas Meta says something along the lines of "the European regulatory environment is too â€˜unpredictable'", what I'm reading is "we've trained our models with more than questionable data, some of it probably not even sustainably sourced, and with insufficient guardrails for consumer usage that would run afoul of many of the common-sense rules the EU is putting around AI. We just can't be arsed to put in the effort". We need to draw a clear line to prevent AI becoming a lawless no man's land where everything goes and if companies like Meta don't want to be part of it, so be it.
