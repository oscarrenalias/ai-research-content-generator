#Facebook and hashtag#WhatsApp, cry me a f*cking river: https://lnkd.in/dk4dCnP. This is the interesting tidbit: "WhatsApp's view is that the terms may spook users about what data WhatsApp actually collects, giving it a competitive disadvantage to iMessage".

Maybe if Facebook's apps weren't a hashtag#people and hashtag#privacy monetization machine, people wouldn't get "spooked"??
