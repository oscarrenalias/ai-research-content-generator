Very disappointing to see that hashtag#Accenture are formally ramping down our global enterprise hashtag#DEI efforts. Remains to be seen how much things will change in Europe since hashtag#DEI was already mostly embedded into our corporate culture, but disappointing to lose global commitment to it nonetheless. 

Itâ€™s easy to support DEI when things go well but true conviction in DEI should be demonstrated in difficult moments like this. What kind of principles do we hold if they change every time a new federal government is sworn in?
