Not sure whether to tag this as hashtag#confirmationbias or hashtag#toldya, maybe both, but it's an interesting perspective on hashtag#Meta, it's failed attempts at remaining relevant now that their business model of "the user is the product" isn't working so well anymore, and how its hashtag#metaverse ambitions are nothing but a money pit: https://lnkd.in/dsc7CYey.

In my opinion, Meta's failure is a pre-requisite for the hashtag#metaverse (the concept, not Meta's platform) to succeed.
