“Dear American government,

please legislate against companies that are not OpenAI — specifically, Chinese ones. 

Also, pretty please deregulate to allow us to ignore every established copyright law; we know our product is built on the real work of hundreds of millions of people from pretty much the beginning of history and it would be unfair to make a profit without compensating copyright holders, but who cares, it’s progress! Make American AI Great Again! hashtag#MAAGA

Yours truly,
OpenAI”
