According to a whistleblower within Facebook, their algorithm prioritizes content that will make its users angry in order to increase engagement. And more engagement leads to more clicks and more revenue. I don't know how humanity managed to get to this point.

"'Its own research is showing that content that is hateful, that is divisive, that is polarizing, it’s easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,' Haugen told 60 Minutes.
'Facebook has realized that if they change the algorithm to be safer, people will spend less time on the site, they’ll click on less ads, they’ll make less money,' Haugen continued."
