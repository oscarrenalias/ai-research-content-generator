I'm really excited about hashtag#GitHub's Codespaces as well as Copilot. Not just because they're really cool product features from a technology standpoint, but because they're a really easy way to make an entire developer workforce way more productive with very little effort (essentially, in the time it takes to put someone's credit card in the GitHub settings :))
