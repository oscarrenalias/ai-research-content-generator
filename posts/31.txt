A great article that talks about the "attention economy" in a digital world, and how apps and services are trying to grab too much of a resource that by itself is already very limited: https://lnkd.in/dUCwHC9c. 

One of the worst examples is LinkedIn, where my feed has become infested with unsolicited videos that play automatically trying to get a click. I just saw a particularly obnoxious one, with very bright green graphics and constant transitions, which made it impossible to focus on anything else until it scrolled out of view. 

Last but not least, this other article talks about what Apple could do in iOS to control the end to end user experience on iOS, like system-wide autoplay settings for videos, infinite feeds converted into standard page scrolling, hide/disable the most distracting parts of apps, and a few more disruptive ideas that could reduce the attention that apps demand from us nowadays: https://lnkd.in/d_ghkTtA
